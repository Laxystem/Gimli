# Contributing to Project: Gimli

Project: Gimli is available on [Codeberg](https://Codeberg.org/Laxystem/Gimli),
and mirrored on [GitHub](https://GitHub.com/Laxystem/Gimli).

## Always Ask, Not to Ask

Always ask if unsure. Don't ask to ask, just ask.

Creating an entire issue for minor problems and/or questions is fine and encouraged.
However, make sure your question hasn't been asked already.

An exception to this rule is "when?". Gimli is a hobby project.

## PRs

*Always* PR into the `development` branch of the Codeberg repository.

### Moving and Renaming Files

When moving files, make sure git recognizes the file was moved.
This is usually done by creating separate commits for changing and moving a file.

### Merge/Rebase/Squash

We only allow merges.

* Rebasing removes commit signatures.
* Squashes destroy the branch graph.

Feel free to squash/rebase locally, as long as it only affects your own commits.

### Last Checks

Before committing and submitting a PR, perform the following steps.

1. Run all tests, and make sure tests that have succeeded before your commit still do.
2. Update or create tests for functionality you've changed.
3. Update or create documentation (via [KDoc](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-doc.html)).
4. If you've updated or added dependencies, update [`DEPENDENCIES.md`](DEPENDENCIES.md).
5. If you've changed federation behavior, update [`FEDERATION.md`](FEDERATION.md).

## Libraries, Frameworks & Tooling

Make sure you know how the libraries and frameworks Gimli uses work (or at least, how to use them),
especially [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs), [SQL](https://postgresql.org/docs),
and [KotlinX Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-guide.html).

## Out of Scope

Feel free to fork Gimli if you want to add any of the below features, because we won't. Try convincing the maintainer
otherwise on their [mastodon account](https://tech.lgbt/@laxla), not via issues nor PRs.

If you don't know how to (theoretically) implement an out-of-scope feature, and/or won't be able to help, rest assured
it'll remain out of scope.

### Turning Gimli Into a Forge

Gimli is a social network, not a git forge.
*However*, adding compatibility between Gimli and ForgeFed features is within scope, and actually planned.
Gimli *won't* host Git repositories.

### Cryptocurrency & NFTs

Sorry, the maintainer's cryptography knowledge is lacking. Besides, the real Web3 is the Fediverse.

### Custom Profile HTML/CSS/JS/etc.

Gimli is intended to be a cross-platform project.
As such, we need to support platforms that don't support HTML, CSS, and JS.

### Other Languages

Gimli is built in Kotlin.
Usage of other languages is only allowed when strictly necessary to allow anyone to contribute to any part of Project:
Gimli.

Gimli may have projects in other languages (in a separate repository) in the future.

## FAQ

### What's the `laxystem` branch?

It's the maintainer's personal branchâ€”Codeberg doesn't allow forking your own repos.

## Code Style

Note the below is merely guidelines. Feel free to ignore them in cases they produce cursed code.

* "Code element" and "element" are any `fun`ction, `val`ue, `var`iable, `class`, `interface`, `object`, etc.
* "Property" is any Kotlin property.
    * "`val`ue" is an explicitly immutable property.
    * "`var`iable" is an explicitly mutable property.

### Nesting & Indentation

Gimli code focuses on readability, not on nesting.

Kotlin is a nesting-heavy language, and nesting purists will sometimes have to survive over *six* levels of nestings.

For indentation, use four spaces or a tab character.
However, do *not* refactor lines you haven't otherwise changed to use your favorite, to avoid uselessly long diffs.

Gimli may restrict indentation further in the future, only allowing tabs.

### Files

This repository contains two types of Kotlin files.

* [Utility Files](#utility-files)
* [Class Files](#class-files)

Sort code elements by usage.
If `foo()` calls `bar()`, `bar()` should be written first.

#### Utility Files

Contain *zero* non-`private` top-level `class`es, `interface`s and `object`s.

Have a variety of utility `fun`ctions and `val`ues.

May be turned into Class Files by wrapping them with an `object`, or with a `class` and `companion object`.

Prefer only using Utility Files in [`:util`](util/README.md) and its submodules, where the classes are defined in other
modules.
When creating extension functions for a `class` defined in the same module, define them in its or a
related `companion object`.

#### Class Files

Contain a *single* non-`private` top-level code element, which must be `class`, `interface`, or `object`.

Use a `companion object` to declare extension functions within the same file.

Within classes, sort elements in the following way. Note that within categories,
elements must be sorted the same way as top-level elements.

```kotlin
private class MyClassImpl // used by MyClass

class MyClass {
    // field-ful values
    val value = TODO()

    // field-ful variables
    var variable = TODO()

    // <overriding field-ful values and variables>

    // fieldless values
    val getter get() = TODO()

    // fieldless variables
    var getterAndSetter
        get() = TODO()
        set(value) = TODO()

    // <overriding fieldless values and variables>

    // secondary constructors
    constructor()

    // functions and sub-classes
    fun function() = TODO()

    class Subclass

    override fun overridingFunction() = TODO()

    // and lastly, the companion object

    companion object
}
```
