## Design Language

Project: Gimli uses [Material 3](https://m3.material.io).

### Palette

The primary color is:

<p style="background-color: #B63D0C; border-radius: 8px; text-align: center">#B63D0C</p>

The full palette will be automatically generated,
a preview of which is [available on figma](https://www.figma.com/file/XcNlZiYl8XdyqEw6Xu9Tip/Project%3A-Gimli-Palette?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=4Ik2RjiuI0mwZ49u-1).

The user may override this to a custom color (on Android, this color may be generated from the user's wallpaper).

Individual posts and profiles may have a different accent color, based on their banner pictureâ€”if they have one.
